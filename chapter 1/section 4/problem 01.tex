\label{1.4.1}

If $f, g$ are regular functions on open subsets $U, V$ of a variety $X$, and if $f = g$ on $U \cap V$, show that the function which is $f$ on $U$ and $g$ on $V$ is a regular function on $U \cup V$. Conclude that if $f$ is a \emph{rational} funciton on $X$, then there is a largest open subset $U$ of $X$ on which $f$ is represented by a regular function. We say that $f$ is \emph{defined} at the poonts of $U$.
