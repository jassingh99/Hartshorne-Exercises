\label{1.4.10}

Let $Y$ be the cuspial cubic curve $y^2 = x^3$ in $\A^2$. Blow up the point $O = (0, 0)$, let $E$ be the exceptional curve, and let $\widetilde{Y}$ be the strict transform of $Y$. Show that $E$ meets $\widetilde{Y}$ in one point, and that $\widetilde{Y} \cong \A^1$. In this case the morphism $\phi: \widetilde{Y} \longrightarrow Y$ is a homeomorphism, but it is not an isomorphism.
