Show that the quadric surface $Q$ defined by $xy = zw$ in $\P^3$ is birational to $\P^2$, but not isomorphic to $\P^2$ (cf. Exc. \ref{1.2.15}).

\begin{proof}
    Recall that $Q = \P^1 \times \P^1$. Consider then $(\P^1 - P) \times (\P^1 - P)$ for some point $P \in \P^1$. This is an open subset of $\P^1 \times \P^1$. Furthermore, $\P^1 - P \cong \A^1$ so this open subset is isomorphic to $\A^1 \times \A^1 \cong \A^2$. Hence, an open subset of $Q$ is isomorphic to $\A^2$, which is rational.

    Also, recall by \ref{1.3.7}.a that any two curves in $\P^2$ intersect. However, by \ref{1.2.15}, there are curves in $Q$ which do not intersect. For instance, let $P \neq P'$ be distinct points in $\P^1$. Then $\P^1 \times P$ and $\P^1 \times P'$ are disjoint curves in $Q$. Thus, $Q$ and $\P^2$ are not even homeomorphic.

    Remark: By the link in exc. \ref{1.4.3}.b we have that every map $\P^2 \longrightarrow \P^1$ is constant, so every map $\P^2 \longrightarrow Q$ is constant as well, so there is absolutely no chance of an isomorphism.
\end{proof}
