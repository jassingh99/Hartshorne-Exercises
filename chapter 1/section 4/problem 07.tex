Let $X$ and $Y$ be two varieties. Suppose there are points $P \in X$ and $Q \in Y$ such that the local rigns $\mathcal O_{X, P}$ and $\mathcal O_{Y, Q}$ are isomorphic as $k$-algebras. Then show that there are open sets $P \in U \subseteq X$ and $Q \in V \subseteq Y$ and an isomorphism $U \longrightarrow V$ which sends $P$ to $Q$.
