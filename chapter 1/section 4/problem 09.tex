\label{1.4.9}

Let $X$ be a projective variety of dimension $r$ in $\P^n$ with $n \geq r + 2$. Show that for a suitable choice of $P \notin X$, and a linear $\P^{n - 1} \subseteq \P^n$, the projection from $P$ to $\P^{n - 1}$ (Exc. \ref{1.3.4}) induces a \emph{birational} morphism of $X$ onto its image $X' \subseteq \P^{n - 1}$. You will need to use \cite[I.4.6A, I.4.7A, I.4.8A]{hartshorne}. This showsin particular that the birational map of \cite[I.4.9]{hartshorne} can be obtained by a finite number of such projections.
