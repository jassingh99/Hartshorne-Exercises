\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Let $f$ be the rational function on $\P^2$ given by $f = \frac{x_1}{x_0}$. Find the set of points where $f$ is defined and describe the corresponding regular function.

    \item Now think of this function as a rational map $\P^2 \longrightarrow \A^1$. Embed $\A^1$ in $\P^1$, and let $\phi: \P^2 \longrightarrow \P^1$ be the resulting rational map. Find the set of points where $\phi$ is defined, and describe the corresponding morphism.
