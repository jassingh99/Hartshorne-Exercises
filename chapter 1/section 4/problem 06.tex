\emph{Plane Cremona Transformations.}

A birational map $\P^2 \longrightarrow \P^2$ is called a \emph{plane Cremona transformation}. We give an example, called a \emph{quadratic transformation}. It is the rational map $\phi: \P^2 \longrightarrow \P^2$ given by $[a_0 : a_1 : a_2] \mapsto [a_1 a_2 : a_0 a_2 : a_0 a_1]$ when no two of the $a_0, a_1, a_2$ are $0$.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Show that $\phi$ is birational, and is its own inverse.

    \item Find open sets $U, V \subseteq \P^2$ such that $\phi: U \longrightarrow V$ is an isomorphism.

    \item Find the open sets where $\phi$ and $\phi^{-1}$ are defined, and describe the corresponding morphisms.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
        \item Note that when $a_0, a_1, a_2$ are all nonzero then $[a_1 a_2 : a_0 a_2 : a_0 a_1] = [1/a_0 : 1/a_1 : 1/a_2] (a_0 a_1 a_2)$, and $[a_0 : a_1 : a_2] \mapsto [1/a_0 : 1/a_1 : 1/a_2]$ is indeed its own inverse.

        \item As just discussed in part (a), on the open subset $\P^2 - Z(x_0 x_1 x_2)$ this map is an involution.

        \item The definition in the problem statement holds on $\P^2 - Z(x_1 x_2, x_0 x_2, x_0 x_1)$. Is this open subset maximal? Observe that $P \in Z(x_1 x_2, x_0 x_2, x_0 x_1)$ iff exactly two of its entries are $0$. That is, it consists of $\{[0 : 0 : 1], [0 : 1 : 0], [1 : 0 : 0]\}$. We therefore want to determine if we can extend $\phi$ to any of these three points. I'm not sure how to do this, but I'm pretty sure you can't.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
