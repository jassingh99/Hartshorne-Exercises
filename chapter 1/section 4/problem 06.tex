\emph{Plane Cremona Transformations.}

A birational map $\P^2 \longrightarrow \P^2$ is called a \emph{plane Cremona transformation}. We give an example, called a \emph{quadratic transformation}. It is the rational map $\phi: \P^2 \longrightarrow \P^2$ given by $[a_0 : a_1 : a_2] \mapsto [a_1 a_2 : a_0 a_2 : a_0 a_1]$ when no two of the $a_0, a_1, a_2$ are $0$.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Show that $\phi$ is birational, and is its own inverse.

    \item Find open sets $U, V \subseteq \P^2$ such that $\phi: U \longrightarrow V$ is an isomorphism.

    \item Find the open sets where $\phi$ and $\phi^{-1}$ are defined, and describe the corresponding morphisms.
\end{enumerate}
