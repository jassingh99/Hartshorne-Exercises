\label{1.4.8}

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Show that any variety of positive dimension over $k$ has the same cardinality as $k$. [\emph{Hints:} Do $\A^n$ and $\P^n$ first. Then for any $X$, use induction on the dimension of $n$. Use \cite[I.4.9]{hartshorne} to make $X$ birational to a hypersurface $H \subseteq \P^{n - 1}$. Use Exc. \ref{1.3.7} to show that the projection of $H$ to $\P^n$ from a point not on $H$ is finite-to-one and surjective.]

    \item Dedeuce that any two \emph{curves} over $k$ are homeomorphic (cf. Exc. \ref{1.3.1}).
