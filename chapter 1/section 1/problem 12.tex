\label{1.1.12}

Give an example of an irreducible polynomial $f \in \R[x, y]$, whose zero set
$Z(f)$ in $\A^2$ is not irreducible.

\begin{proof}
    Consider the irreducible polynomial $f = x^2 + y^2 + 1$. Its zero set is empty and therefore not irreducible.
    
    $\langle$Let's find a less trivial example - such an $f$ with $Z(f) \neq \emptyset$.$\rangle$
\end{proof}
