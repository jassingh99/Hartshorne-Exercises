If we identify $\A^2$ with $\A^1 \times \A^1$ in the natural way, show that the Zariski topology on $\A^2$ is not the product topology of the Zariski topologies on the two copies of $\A^1$.

\begin{proof}
    The diagonal of $\A^2$ is defined by $Z(x - y)$, which is closed. If these topologies agreed, then the diagonal of $\A^1 \times \A^1$ will be closed so $\A^1$ will be Hausdorff. However, the topology on $\A^1$ is the cofinite topology and is therefore not Hausdorff.
\end{proof}
