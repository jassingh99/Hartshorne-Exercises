\label{1.1.11}

Let $Y \subseteq \A^3$ be the curve given parametrically by $x = t^3, y = t^4, z = t^5$. Show that $I(Y)$ is a prime ideal of height $2$ in $k[x,y,z]$ which cannot be generated by $2$ elements. We say $Y$ is \textit{not a local complete intersection}---cf. (Ex. \ref{1.2.17}).

\begin{proof}
    First of all, consider the map $k[x, y, z] \longrightarrow k[t]$ via $x \mapsto t^3$, $y\mapsto t^4$, $z \mapsto t^5$. As discussed previously, we are justified in using the same name for the variables of the coordinate ring and the coordinates on affine space themselves because for an infinite field (such as the algebraically closed field $k$ we work over) polynomials are identified with polynomials. This map has kernel $I(Y)$ by definition. Its image is $k[t^3, t^4, t^5]$, a domain, so $I(Y)$ is prime. Furthermore, $\dim k[x, y, z]/I(Y) = 3 - \codim I(Y)$. Hence, to compute the codimension of $I(Y)$, we need only compute the dimension of $k[x, y, z]/I(Y) \cong k[t^3, t^4, t^5]$. Observe that $k[t^3, t^4, t^5] \subseteq k[t]$ is integral. Indeed, $t$ satisfies the monic polynomial $s^3 - t^3$. Hence, its dimension is $\dim k[t] = 1$. Then $\codim I(Y) = 2$ as desired.
    
    Let $\m = (x, y, z)$. We claim that $(S) / \m (S) \cong \sum_{s \in S} k \cdot s$ for any $S \subseteq k[x, y, z]$. Indeed, any element of $(S)/ \m (S)$ is represented by some $\sum f_i s_i$. Let's analyze one such $f s = \parens{\sum a_{ijk} x^i y^j z^k} s$. For all $(i, j, k) \neq (0, 0, 0)$, $a_{ijk} x^i y^j z^k \in \m$. Hence, $f s \equiv a_{000} s \pmod{\m (S)}$. Thus, $\sum f_i s_i \equiv \sum f_i(0) s_i \pmod{\m (S)}$. In other words, every element of $(S) / \m (S)$ is represented by some element of $\sum_{s \in S} k \cdot s$. On the other hand, if $\sum a_i s_i \equiv \sum b_j s_j \pmod{\m (S)}$ for $a_i, b_j \in k$ then $\sum a_i s_i - \sum b_j s_j \in \m (S)$. Hence, evaluating the $a_i, b_j$ at $0$ sends this to $0$. These are constants, so the difference is $0$ and $\sum a_i s_i = \sum b_j s_j$. This proves the isomorphism.
    
    Observe that $x^3 - zy, y^2 - xz, z^2 - x^2 y \in I(Y) = I$ all have different $x$ degrees. Hence, they are $k$ linearly independent. Let $(S) = I$ with $x^3 - zy, y^2 - xz, z^2 - x^2 y \in S$. Then as above, $I / \m I \cong \sum_{s \in S} k \cdot s$. As $\{x^3 - zy, y^2 - xz, z^2 - x^2 y\}$ is $k$ linearly independent, $\sum_{s \in S} k \cdot s$ has dimension at least $3$. Furthermore, the above paragraph shows that any generating set of $I$ spans $I / \m I$. Hence, any generating set of $I$ must have at least $\dim I /\m I \geq 3$ elements.
