\label{1.1.9}

Let $\a \subseteq A = k[x_1 ... ,x_n]$ be an ideal which can be generated by $r$ elements. Then every irreducible component of $Z(\a)$ has dimension $ \geq n - r$.

\begin{proof}
    Let $F$ be an irreducible component of $Z(\a)$. Then $F = Z(\p)$ for some prime ideal $\p$. As $F$ is an irreducible component, it is maximal with respect to being an irreducible closed subset of $Z(\a)$ and $\p$ is therefore minimal with respect to containing $\a$. $\a$ can be generated by $r$ elements so by Krull's height theorem (a generalization of the principal ideal theorem), $\codim p \leq r$. Using \cite[13.4]{eisenbudcommutative}, we arrive at the equation $\dim A/\p + \codim p = \dim A$. Of course, $\dim A = n$ and $\dim A/\p = \dim F$. Hence, $\dim F + \codim p = n$. As $\codim p \leq r$, $\dim F \geq n - r$.
\end{proof}
