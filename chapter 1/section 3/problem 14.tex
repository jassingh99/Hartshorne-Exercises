\emph{Projection from a Point}

Let $\P^n$ be a hyperplane in $\P^{n+1}$ and let $P \in \P^{n + 1} - \P^n$. Define a mapping $\phi: \P^{n + 1} = \curly{P} \longrightarrow \P^n$ by $\phi(Q) = $ the itnersection of the unique line containing $P$ and $Q$ with $\P^n$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Show that $\phi$ is a morphism.

    \item Let $Y \susbeteq \P^3$ be the twisted cubic curve which is the image of the $3$-uple embedding of $\P^1$ (\ref{1.2.12}). If $t, u$ are homogeneous coordinates on $\P^1$, we say that $Y$ is a curve given \emph{parametrically} by $(x, y, z, w) = (t^3, t^2 u, t u^2, y^3)$. Let $P = [0 : 0 : 1 : 0]$, and let $\P^2$ be the hyperplane $z = 0$. Show that the projection of $Y$ from $P$ is a cuspidal cubic curve in the plane, and find its equation.
