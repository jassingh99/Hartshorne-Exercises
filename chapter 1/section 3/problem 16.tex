\emph{Products of Quasi-Projective Varieties}

Use the Segre embedding \ref{1.2.14} to identify $\P^n \times \P^m$ with its image and hence give it a structure of a projective variety. Now for any teo quasi-projective varieties $X \subseteq \P^n$ and $Y \subseteq \P^m$, consider $X \times Y \subseteq \P^n \times \P^m$

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Show that $X \times Y$ is a quasi-projective variety.

    \item If $X, Y$ are both projective, show that $X \times Y$ is projective.

    \item Show that $X \times Y$ is a product in the category of varieties.
\end{enumerate}
