\emph{Subvarieties}

A subset of a topological space is \emph{locally closed} if it is an open subset of its closure, or, equivalently, if it is the intersection of an open set with a closed set.

If $X$ is a quasi-affine or quasi-projective variety and $Y$ is an irreducible locally closed subset, then $Y$ is also quasi-affine (respectively, quasi-projective) variety, by virtue of being a locally closed subset of the same affine of projective space. We call this the \emph{induced structure} on $Y$, and we call $Y$ a \emph{subvariety} of $X$.

Now let $\phi: X \longrightarrow Y$ be a morphism and let $X' \subseteq X$ and $Y' \subseteq Y$ be irreducible locally closed subsets such that $\phi[X'] = Y'$. Show that $\phi|_{X'}: X' \longrightarrow Y'$ is a morphism.
