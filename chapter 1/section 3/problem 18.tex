\emph{Projectively Normal Varieties}

A projective variety $Y \subseteq \P^n$ is \emph{projectively normal} (with respect to the given embedding) if its homogeneous coordinate ring $S(Y)$ is integrally closed.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item If $Y$ is projectively normal then $Y$ is normal.

    \item There are normal varieties in projective space which are not projectively normal. For example, let $Y$ be the twisted quartic curve in $\P^3$ given parametrically by $(x, y, z, w) = (t^4, t^3 u, t^2 u^2, t u^3, u^4)$. Then $Y$ is normal by not projectively normal. See \ref{3.5.6} for more examples.

    \item Show that the twisted quartic curve $Y$ above is isomorphic to $\P^1$, which is projectively normal. Thus projective normality depends on the embedding.
\end{enumerate}
