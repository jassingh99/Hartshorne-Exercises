\emph{The Local Ring of a Subvariety}

Let $Y \subseteq X$ be a subvariety. Let $\mathcal O_{Y, X}$ be the set of equivalence classes $(U, f)$ where $U \subseteq X$ is open, $U \cap Y \neq \emptyset$, and $f$ is a regular function of $U$. We say that $(U, f)$ is equivalent to $(V, g)$ if $f = g$ on $U \cap V$. Show that $\mathcal O_{Y, X}$ is a local ring, with residue field $K(Y)$ and dimension $= \dim X - \dim Y$. It is the \emph{local ring} of $Y$ on $X$. Note that if $Y = \curly{P}$ is a point we get $\mathcal O_P$, and if $Y = X$ we get $K(X)$. Note also that if $Y$ is not a point, then $K(Y)$ is not algebraically closed, so in this way we get local rings whose residue fields are not algebraically closed.
