\label{1.3.1}

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Show that any conic in $\A^2$ is either isomorphic to $\A^1$ or $\A^1 - 0$ (c.f \ref{1.1.1}).

    \item Show that $\A^1$ is \emph{not} isomorphic to any proper open subset of itself. (This result is generalized by \ref{1.6.7} below).

    \item Any conic in $\P^2$ is isomorphic to $\P^1$.

    \item We will see later (\ref{1.4.8}) that any two curves are homeomorphic. But show now that $\A^2$ is not even homeomorphic to $\P^2$.

    \item If an affine variety is isomorphic to a projective variety, then it consists of only one point.
\end{enumerate}
