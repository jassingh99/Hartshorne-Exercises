\emph{Group Varieties}

A group variety consists of a variety $Y$ together with a morphism $Y \times Y \longrightarrow Y$, such that the set of points of $Y$ with the operation given by $\mu$ is a group, and such that the inverse map $y \mapsto y^{-1}$ is also a morphism of $Y \longrightarrow Y$.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item The \emph{additive group} $\mathbf G_{a}$ is given by the variety $\A^1$ and the morphism $\mu: \A^2 \longrightarrow \A^1$ defined by $\mu(a, b) = a + b$. Show it is a group variety.

    \item The \emph{multiplicative group} $\mathbf G_m$ is given by the variety $\A^1 - 9$ and the morphism $\mu(a, b) = ab$. Show it is a group variety.

    \item If $G$ is a group variety, and $X$ is any variety, show that the set $\Hom(X, G)$ has a natural group structure.

    \item For any variety $X$ show that $\Hom(X, \mathbf G_a)$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal O(X)$ as a group under addition.

    \item For any variety $X$ show that $\Hom(X, \mathbf G_m)$ is isomorphic to the group of units in $\mathcal O(X)$ under multiplication.
