\emph{Products of Affine Varieties}

Let $X \subseteq \A^n$ and $Y \subseteq \A^m$ be affine varieties.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Show that $X \times Y \subseteq \A^{n + m}$ with its induced topology is irreducible. [\emph{Hint}: Suppose that $X \times Y$ is a union of two closed subsets $Z_1 \cup Z_2$. Let $X_i = \curly{x \in X | x \times Y \subseteq Z_i}$. Show that $X = X_1 \cup X_2$ and $X_1, X_2$ are closed. Then $X = X_1$ or $X_2$ so $X \times Y = Z_1$ or $Z_2$.] The affine variety $X \times Y$ is called the \emph{product} of $X$ and $Y$. Note that its topology is in general not equal to the product topology (\ref{1.1.4}).

    \item Show that $A(X \times Y) \cong A(X) \otimes_k A(Y)$.

    \item Show that $X \times Y$ is a product in the category of varieties.

    \item Show that $\dim X \times Y = \dim X + \dim Y$.
