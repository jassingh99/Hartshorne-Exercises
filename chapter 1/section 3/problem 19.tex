\emph{Automorphisms of $\A^n$}

Let $\phi: \A^n \longrightarrow \A^n$ be a morphism of $\A^n$ to $\A^n$ given by $n$ polynomials $f_1, \dots, f_n$ of $n$ variables $x_1, \dots, x_n$. Let $J = \det \pipe{\diff{f_i}{x_j}}}$ be the Jacobian polynomial of $\phi$.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item If $\phi$ is an isomorphism (in which case we call $\phi$ an \emph{automorphism} of $\A^n$) show that $J$ is a nonzero constant polynomial.

    \item The converse of (a) is an unsolved problem, even for $n = 2$. See, for example, Vitushkin [1].
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}
    This would follow immediate from an ``algebraic chain rule," which I was unable (or rather, unwilling...) to bash out at the moment. Indeed, if we let $J_\phi$ be the Jacobian matrix of $\phi$ then we hope to prove the identity $(J_\phi \circ \psi) (J_\psi) = J_{\phi \circ \psi}$ by analogy to the normal multivariable chain rule. If we had that result, then multiplicativity of the determinant would give us the result.
\end{proof}
