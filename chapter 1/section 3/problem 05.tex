By abuse of language, we will say that a variety ``is affine" if it is isomorphic to an affine variety. If $H \subseteq \P^n$ is any hypersurface, show that $\P^n - H$ is affine. [\emph{Hint}: Let $H$ have degree $d$. Then consider the $d$-uple embedding of $\P^n$ in $\P^N$ and use the fact that $\P^N$ minus a hyperplace is affine.]
