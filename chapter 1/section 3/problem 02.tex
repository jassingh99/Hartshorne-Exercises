\label{1.3.2}

A morphism whose unerlying map on the topological spaces is a homeomorphism need not be an isomorphism.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item For example, let $\phi: \A^1 \longrightarrow \A^2$ be defined by $t \mapsto (t^2, t^3)$. Show that $\phi$ defines a bijective bicontinuous morphism on $\A^1$ onto the curve $y^2 = x^3$, but that $\phi$ is not an isomorphism.

    \item For another example, let the characteristic of the base field $k$ be $p > )$ and define a map $\phi: \A^1 \longrightarrow \A^1$ by $t \mapsto t^p$. Show that $\phi$ is bijective and bicontinuous but not an isomorphism. This is called the \emph{Frobenius morphism}.
