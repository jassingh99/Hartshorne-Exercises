\textit{The $d-Uple$ Embedding}. For given $n, d > 0$, let $M_0, M_1, \dots ,M_N$ be all the monomials of degree $d$ in the $n + 1$ variables $x_0 , \dots, x^n$, where $N = \binom{n + d}{n} - 1$. We
define a mapping $\rho_d: \P^n \longrightarrow \P^N$ by sending the point $P = (a_0, \dots ,a_n)$ to the point $\rho_d(P) = (M_0(a), \dots ,M_N(a))$ obtained by substituting the $a_i$ in the monomials $M_j$. This is called the $d$-uple \textit{embedding} of $\P^n$ in $\P^N$. For example, if $n = 1$, $d = 2$, then
$N = 2$, and the image $Y$ of the 2-uple embedding of $\P^1$ in $\P^2$ is a conic.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Let $\theta: k[y_0 , \dots, y_N] \longrightarrow k[x_0 , \dots, x_n]$ be the homomorphism defined by sending $y_i$ to $M_i$, and let $\a$ be the kernel of $\theta$. Then $\a$ is a homogeneous prime ideal, and so $Z(\a)$ is a projective variety in $\P^N$.
    
    \item Show that the image of $\P^d$ is exactly $Z(\a)$. (One inclusion is easy. The other will require some calculation.)
    
    \item Now show that $\rho_d$ is a homeomorphism of $P^n$ onto the projective variety $Z(\a)$.
    
    \item Show that the twisted cubic curve in $\P^3$ (Ex. \ref{1.2.9}) is equal to the 3-uple embedding of $\P^1$ in $\P^3$, for suitable choice of coordinates.
\end{enumerate}
