If $Y$ is a projective variety with homogeneous coordinate ring $S(Y)$, show that
$\dim S(Y) = \dim Y + 1$. [\textit{Hint}: Let $\varphi_i: U_i \longrightarrow \A^n$ be the homeomorphism of \cite[2.2]{hartshorne},
let $Y_i$ be the affine variety $\phi_i[Y \cap U_i]$, and let $A(Y_i)$ be its affine coordinate ring. Show that $A(Y_i)$ can be identified with the subring of elements of degree $0$ of the
localized ring $S(Y)_{x_i}$Â· Then show that $S(Y)_{x_i} \cong A(Y_i)[x, x^{-1}]$. Now use \cite[1.7]{hartshorne},
\cite[1.8A]{hartshorne}, and (Ex \ref{1.1.10}), and look at transcendence degrees. Conclude also that $\dim Y = \dim Y_i$ whenever $Y_i$ is nonempty.]

\begin{proof}
    We will follow this hint. We want to identity $A(Y_i)$ with $(S(Y)_{x_i})^0$, which is the set of all $\frac{f}{x_i^d}$ such that $f \in k[x_0, \dots, x_n]$ is homogeneous of degree $d$. We will consider the coordinate ring $A(Y_i)$ to have coordinates $x_0, \dots, \widehat{x_i}, \dots, x_n$. We define the map

    \begin{align*}
        k[x_0, \dots, \widehat{x_i}, \dots, x_n] &\longrightarrow (S(Y)_{x_i})^0\\
        f &\mapsto f\parens{\frac{x_0}{x_i}, \dots, \widehat{\frac{x_i}{x_i}}, \dots, \frac{x_n}{x_i}}
    \end{align*}

    It's not hard to see that this lands in the degree $0$ subring. We want this map to factor through $A(Y_i)$. What then is $J(Y_i)$? By definition, it is the $f \in k[a_0, \dots, \widehat{a_i}, \dots, a_n]$ such that $f(a) = 0$ for all $a \in Y_i$. Of course, $Y_i = \phi_i[Y \cap U_i]$ so any such $a$ will look like $\parens{\frac{a_0}{a_1}, \dots, \widehat{\frac{a_i}{a_i}}, \dots, \frac{a_n}{a_i}}$. Indeed, take some $f \in J(Y_i)$. Then $f$ is mapped to $\frac{\beta_i(f)}{a_i^d}$ where $\beta_i(f)$ is the homogenization of $f$ with respect to $a_i$, i.e. $\beta_i(f) = a_i^d f\parens{\frac{a_0}{a_i}, \dots, \widehat{\frac{a_i}{a_i}}, \dots, \frac{a_n}{a_i}}$. Here  we of course mean $d = \deg f$. Now, if $d = 0$ then $f$ is constant and vanishes on $Y_i$, so it must be $0$ (or $Y_i$ must be empty but this is a case we ignore). If $d \neq 0$ then consider some $[a_0 : \dots : a_n] \in Y$. If $a_i = 0$ then $\beta_i(f)([a_0 : \dots : a_n]) = a_i^d f\parens{\frac{a_0}{a_i}, \dots, \widehat{\frac{a_i}{a_i}}, \dots, \frac{a_n}{a_i}} = 0$ as $d > 0$. On the other hand, if $a_i \neq 0$ then the term $f\parens{\frac{a_0}{a_i}, \dots, \widehat{\frac{a_i}{a_i}}, \dots, \frac{a_n}{a_i}} = 0$ as $f \in J(Y_i)$. In any case, we see therefore that $\beta_i(f) \in I(Y)$. Hence, $\frac{\beta_i(f)}{x_i^d} \in I(Y)_{x_i}$. By flatness of localization, $S(Y)_{x_i} = k[x_0, \dots, x_n]_{x_i} / I(Y)_{x_i}$. Thus, we can quotient this map to yield $A(Y_i) \longrightarrow (S(Y)_{x_i})^0$. 

    We now seek to show that this map is an isomorphism, which we will do by exhibiting aninverse. Recall the ``dehomogenization" of $f$ with respect to $x_i$ is $\alpha_i(f) = f(x_0, \dots, 1, \dots, x_n)$ with $1$ in the $i^{th}$ position. We consider the map $(S(Y)_{x_i})^0 \longrightarrow A(Y_i)$ via $\frac{f}{x_i^d} \mapsto \alpha_i(f)$, where of course $f$ is taken to be homogeneous and degree $d$. In other words, this map evaluates a rational function at $(x_0, \dots, 1, \dots, x_n)$.

    We first have to show that this map is actually well defined on these quotients. Indeed, let's begin with some $f \in I(Y)_{x_i}$ of homogeneous degree $0$, so $f = \frac{g}{x_i^d}$ with $g \in I(Y)^h$ of degree $d$. Then this maps to $g(x_0, \dots, 1, \dots, x_n)$. Take some $\parens{\frac{a_0}{a_1}, \dots, \widehat{\frac{a_i}{a_i}}, \dots, \frac{a_n}{a_i}} \in Y_i$. Then $g(x_0, \dots, 1, \dots, x_n)\parens{\frac{a_0}{a_1}, \dots, \widehat{\frac{a_i}{a_i}}, \dots, \frac{a_n}{a_i}}\right = g\parens{\frac{a_0}{a_i}, \dots, 1, \dots, \frac{a_n}{a_i}} = 0$ as $g \in I(Y)^h$. Thus, this does descend to a well defined map on the quotient $(S(Y)_{x_i})^0$.

    It is now easy enough to verify that these maps are inverse. Let $f \in A(Y_i)$. Then $f \mapsto \frac{\beta_i(f)}{x_i^d} \mapsto \alpha_i(\beta_i(f))$. This is $f\parens{\frac{x_0}{x_i}, \dots, \widehat{\frac{x_i}{x_i}}, \dots, \frac{x_n}{x_i}}(x_0, \dots, 1, \dots, x_n) = f$. On the other hand, let $\frac{f}{x_i^d} \in (S(Y)_{x_i})^0$. Then $\frac{f}{x_i^d} \mapsto \alpha_i(f) \mapsto \frac{\beta_i(\alpha_i(f))}{x_i^d}$. The numerator here is $\beta_i(f(x_0, \dots, 1, \dots, x_n)) = x_i^d f\parens{\frac{x_0}{x_i}, \dots, \frac{x_i}{x_i}, \dots, \frac{x_n}{x_i}} = f$ as $f$ is homogeneous of degree $f$. 

    In summary, we have defined the following maps:

    $$
    \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement = \&, row sep = 0]
        x_j \arrow[r, mapsto] \& \frac{x_j}{x_i} \\
        A(Y_i) \arrow[r, leftrightarrow, "\sim"] \& (S(Y)_{x_i})^0 \\
        \begin{cases}
            1 & i = j\\
            x_j & i \neq j
        \end{cases} \& x_j \arrow[l, mapsto] 
    \end{tikzcd}
    $$

    Next, we will extend this to a map $A(Y_i)[x_i, x_i^{-1}] \longrightarrow S(Y)_{x_i}$ via sending $x_i \mapsto x_i$. The image of this map contains $x_i$, $x_i^{-1}$ and $(S(Y)_{x_i})^0$. Given $f$ homogeneous, $\frac{f}{x_i^d} \in (S(Y)_{x_i})^0$, so $f \in (S(Y)_{x_i})^0[x_i]$. Hence, this map is onto. I'm not yet sure how to prove that it is injective. By flatness, it suffices to show that the map $A(Y_i)[x_i] \longrightarrow S(Y)_{x_i}$ is injective. The fear is that adjoining $x_i$ adds some strange relations to $(S(Y)_{x_i})^0$. If we let $\phi$ denote this map, then we are trying to understand when $\phi(\sum f_k x_i^k) = \sum \phi(f_k) x_i^k = 0$. That is, we want all $\phi(f_k) = 0$ so that each $f_k = 0$, as the above is an isomorphism. 

    What's strange is that the $x_j$ need not be algebraically independent in $S(Y)$. For instance, take $Y = Z(x_0 - 2 x_1)$. Perhaps there is an approach using N\"other's normalization lemma, but from here I am stuck.
\end{proof}
