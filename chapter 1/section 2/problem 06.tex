\label{1.2.6}

If $Y$ is a projective variety with homogeneous coordinate ring $S(Y)$, show that
$\dim S(Y) = \dim Y + 1$. [\textit{Hint}: Let $\varphi_i U_i \longrightarrow \A^n$ be the homeomorphism of \cite[2.2]{hartshorne},
let $Y_i$ be the affine variety $\phi_i[Y \cap U_i]$, and let $A(Y_i)$ be its affine coordinate ring. Show that $A(Y_i)$ can be identified with the subring of elements of degree $0$ of the
localized ring $S(Y)_{x_i}$Â· Then show that $S(Y)_{x_i} \cong A(Y_i)[x, x^{-1}]$. Now use \cite[1.7]{hartshorne}),
\cite[1.8A]{hartshorne}, and (Ex \ref{1.1.10}), and look at transcendence degrees. Conclude also that $dim Y = dim Y_i$ whenever $Y_i$ is nonempty.]
