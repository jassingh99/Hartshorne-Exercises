\textit{Projective Closure of an Affine Variety}. If $Y \subseteq \A^n$ is an affine variety, we identify $\A^n$ with an open set $U_0 \subseteq \P^n$ by the homeomorphism $\varphi_0$. Then we can speak of $\overline{Y}$, the closure of $Y$ in $\P^n$, which is called the \textit{projective closure} of Y.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Show that $I(Y)$ is the ideal generated by $\beta[I(Y)]$, using the notation of the proof of \cite[2.2]{hartshorne}.
    
    \item Let $Y \subseteq \A^3$ be the twisted cubic of (Ex. \ref{1.1.2}). Its projective closure $\overline{Y} \subseteq \P^3$ is called the twisted cubic curve in $\P^3$. Find generators for $I(Y)$ and $I(\overline)$, and use this example to show that if $f_1, \dots, f_r$ generate $I(Y)$, then $\beta(f_1), \dots, \beta(f_r)$ do \textit{not} necessarily generate $I(\overline{Y})$.
