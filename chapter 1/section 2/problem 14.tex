\textit{The Segre Embedding}. Let $\psi: \P^r \times \P^s \longrightarrow \P^N$ be the map defined by sending the
ordered pair $(a_0 , \dots, a_r) \times (b_0 , \dots, b_s)$ to $(\dots, a_i b_j, \dots)$ in lexicographic order, where $N = rs + r + s$. Note that $\psi$ is well-defined and injective. It is called the
\textit{Segre embedding}. Show that the image of $\psi$ is a subvariety of $\P^N$. [\textit{Hint}: Let the
homogeneous coordinates of $\P^N$ be $\{z_{ij} \mid i = 0, \dots, r, j = 0, \dots, s\}$, and let $\a$ be the kernel of the homomorphism $k[{z_{ij}}] \longrightarrow k[x_0 , \dots, x_r, y_0 , \dots, y_s]$ which sends $z_{ij}$ to $x_i y_j$. Then show that $\Im \psi = Z(\a)$.]
