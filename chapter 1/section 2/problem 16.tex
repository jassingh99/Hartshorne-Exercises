\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item The intersection of two varieties need not be a variety. For example, let $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ be the quadric surfaces in $\P^3$ given by the equations $x^2 - yw = 0$ and $xy - zw = 0$, respectively. Show that $Q_1 \cap Q_2$ is the union of a twisted cubic curve and a line.
    
    \item Even if the intersection of two varieties is a variety, the ideal of the intersection may not be the sum of the ideals. For example, let $C$ be the conic in $\P^2$ given by the equation $x^2 - yz = 0$. Let $L$ be the line given by $y = 0$. Show that $C \cap L$ consists of one point $P$, but that $I(C) + I(L) \neq I(P)$.
