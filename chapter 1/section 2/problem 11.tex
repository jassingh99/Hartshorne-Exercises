\textit{Linear Varieties in} $\P^n$. A hypersurface defined by a linear polynomial is called a \textit{hyperplane}.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Show that the following two conditions are equivalent for a variety $Y$ in $\P^n$:
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item $I(Y)$ can be generated by linear polynomials.
        \item $Y$ can be written as an intersection of hyperplanes.
    \end{enumerate}
    In this case we say that $Y$ is a linear variety in $\P^n$.
    
    \item If $Y$ is a linear variety of dimension $r$ in $\P^n$, show that $I(Y)$ is minimally generated by $n - r$ linear polynomials.
    
    \item Let $Y,Z$ be linear varieties in $\P^n$, with $\dim Y = r$, $\dim Z = s$. If $r + s - n \geq 0$, then $Y \cap Z \neq \emptyset$. Furthermore, if $Y \cap Z \neq \emptyset$, then $Y\cap Z$ is a linear variety of dimension $\geq r + s - n$. (Think of $\A^{n + 1}$ as a vector space over $k$, and work with its subspaces.)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item $(i \Longrightarrow ii)$. Let $I(Y) = (f_1, \dots, f_r)$ linear. Then $Y = Z(I(Y)) = \bigcap Z(f_i)$.

        $(ii \Longrightarrow i)$. Let $Y = \bigcap_{i \in I} Z(f_i)$. We therefore have $I(Y) = \sqrt{(f_i : i \in I)}$. As $S$ is N\"otherian we can find a finite set of generators among the $f_i$, i.e. $(f_1, \dots, f_r) = (f_i : i \in I)$. Indeed, find the maximal such finitely generated sub-ideal. Thus, $Y = Z(f_1, \dots, f_r)$. Write $f_i = \sum f_{ij} x_j$. Then $[a_0 : \dots : a_n] \in Y$ iff $(f_{ij})_{ij} \begin{pmatrix}
            a_0\\
            \vdots\\
            a_n
        \end{pmatrix} = 0$. By row or column reduction, we are a linear change of coordinates away from $Y$ being $Z(y_0, \dots, y_s)$ for new coordinates $y_0, \dots, y_n$. (COULD USE SOME MORE DETAIL)

        \item 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
