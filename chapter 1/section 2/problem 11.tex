\textit{Linear Varieties in} $\P^n$. A hypersurface defined by a linear polynomial is called a \textit{hyperplane}.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Show that the following two conditions are equivalent for a variety $Y$ in $\P^n$:
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item $I(Y)$ can be generated by linear polynomials.
        \item $Y$ can be written as an intersection of hyperplanes.
    \end{enumerate}
    In this case we say that $Y$ is a linear variety in $\P^n$.
    
    \item If $Y$ is a linear variety of dimension $r$ in $\P^n$, show that $I(Y)$ is minimally generated by $n - r$ linear polynomials.
    
    \item Let $Y,Z$ be linear varieties in $\P^n$, with $\dim Y = r$, $\dim Z = s$. If $r + s - n \geq 0$, then $Y \cap Z \neq \emptyset$. Furthermore, if $Y \cap Z \neq \emptyset$, then $Y\cap Z$ is a linear variety of dimension $\geq r + s - n$. (Think of $\A^{n + 1}$ as a vector space over $k$, and work with its subspaces.)
\end{enumerate}
